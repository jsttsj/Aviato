Remember that this app only works every 15 minutes due to Twitter API.  Once you load the app, you can search as much as you want.  But you can only load the app once every 15 minutes.

In order to find topics that can be displayed on Plotly, we suggest entering a vowel into the text box initially to find possible results to search and display. 

Also, recently, an error regarding Plotly the lengths of certain traits such as x, y, and color, must be a length of one. It is not clear what the source of this issue is, even after Google searches, but this error only appeared today (12/8) and was not an issue before.

Keep in mind that the code in GitHub will not work when run on a local console; to view the functionality of our application, please use [this website](https://jliang9.shinyapps.io/Aviato/). The repository is to maintain clean code and modularity, but Shiny/ShinyApps cannot understand this.
